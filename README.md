# Kennal-UI-system
UI system for gamemaker written in GML

Originally made for a old project.
Its not the best but its simple, easy to use, has no dependencies and works.

Has support for buttons, text labels, toggles, textboxes, tooltips

There are some sprites in the code you will have to replace with custom ones but that is about it.

# Usage example
```
ui = new Ui(0,0,640,320) //base ui panel

//example of ui elements
unsaveddialog = new UiElement(0.5,0.5,0,0,0.25,0,8,24+8+4,0.5,0.5)
unsaveddialog.text = "are you sure?"
unsaveddialog.text_yscale = 0.25
unsaveddialog.is_visible = false

unsaveddialog_yes = new UiElement(0,1,4,-4,0.5,0,-6,12,0,1)
unsaveddialog_yes.text = "yes"
unsaveddialog_yes.is_button = true

unsaveddialog.Add(unsaveddialog_yes)

unsaveddialog_no = new UiElement(1,1,-4,-4,0.5,0,-6,12,1,1)
unsaveddialog_no.text = "no"
unsaveddialog_no.is_button = true

unsaveddialog.Add(unsaveddialog_no)

//add unsaveddialog to base ui panel
ui.Add(unsaveddialog)
```
